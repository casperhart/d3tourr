title: "Detourr Crosstalk Example"
output: html_document
---

The following example demonstrates the {crosstalk} selecting and filtering with
{detourr}. Note that in this markdown document, the visuals are linked despite
them being in separate chunks. Filtering applies to all visuals, and point 
selection in one visual will be applied to the others.

See https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html for more details.

```{r}
library(detourr)
library(crosstalk)
library(d3scatter)
library(DT)

shared_flea <- SharedData$new(tourr::flea)

a <- d3scatter(shared_flea,
  x = ~tars1, y = ~head, color = ~species,
  width = "100%"
)
b <- detour(
  shared_flea, tour_aes(projection = tars1:aede3, colour = species)
) |>
  show_scatter(width = "100%")

c <- datatable(shared_flea, width = "100%")

bscols(
  list(
    filter_checkbox("species", "Species", shared_flea, ~species),
    filter_slider("head", "Head", shared_flea, ~head, width = "100%")
  ),
  a
)
```

```{r}
bscols(b, c)
```
