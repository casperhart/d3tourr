# d3tourr

Animations for {tourr} using htmlwidgets for performance and portability.

# Installation

This project uses TypeScript code which needs to be compiled and bundled for the package to work. To do this, you will need `node.js`, and `yarn` installed.

After cloning this repository, you can install the `R` package by running the following code from the {d3tourr} folder:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
yarn install
yarn run build
```

Note: Installing using `remotes::install_github` does _not_ work (yet).

# Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(d3tourr)
animate_tour(
  tourr::flea,
  -species,
  display = display_scatter(tour_aes(colour = species)),
  render_opts = list(max_bases = 10)
)
```
